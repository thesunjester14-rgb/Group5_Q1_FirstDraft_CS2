# Group5_Q1_FirstDraft_CS2
Many Filipino children lack access to education due to poverty and insufficient resources, leading to poor academic opportunities and limiting the potential of the younger generation.

# The Uneducated Underprivileged

## Problem Statement
Many poverty-stricken children are uneducated due to their lack of resources needed to seek proper education. Because of the majority of Filipino’s poor income, they are unable to provide the resources needed, such as money, to properly educate their children. Consequently, this causes the majority of children and teens to be uneducated, which leads to the younger generation being severely impacted by poverty and improper education. It is well known that the younger generation is considered to be our only hope, and if this generation is struggling in education, then our only hope will soon be lost.
